# B section

1. Simplest

Bars 1-4 are in the key of Gb major (up a semitone from the A section)

Bars 5-8 are in F# minor (keep the same root, but change to minor)

Bars 9-12 are in G minor (up a semitone)

Bars 13-16 are in F major (leading back to the A section)

2. Major Minor combo

Bars 1-4
Gb major for the Gbmaj7 chord, Gb minor over B9 (II chord is Gbm7)

Bars 5-8
A major over F#m7 (related major), A minor over D9 (II chord is Am7)

Bars 9-12
Bb major over Gm7 (related major), Bb minor over Eb9 (II chord is Bbm7)

Bars 13-16
F major scale, targeting chord tones (notice how the melody targets b5)

3. Major - melodic minor

The B9, D9 and Eb9 are all static dominant chords. Mixolydian could work as a scale over them, but an even better scale choice is the Lydian Dominant mode of Melodic Minor.
Without getting too complicated, this mode is the 4th mode of melodic minor.

Gb melodic minor = Bb Lydian dominant (over B9) A melodic minor = D Lydian dominant (over D9)

Bb melodic minor = Eb Lydian dominant (over Eb9)

Notice that the melodic minor scale in each example = the same relationship as in Approach #2 (ie when thinking “minor” you can think melodic minor).
